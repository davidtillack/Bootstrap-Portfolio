# Bootstrap-Portfolio

<!-- 

Hey!

Welcome to my second take on this website. This website is designed to be more responsive, using Bootstrap and responsive imagery properties, so that it is more than just the basic HTML and CSS website.

To see what I mean in action, try it yourself! Drag the browser around on this bad boy and hopefully (unless I missed something, which is plausible), all the content should shift accordingly.
